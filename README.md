<h1>How to set up this project for development</h1><br/>
This project is created using pycharm. You can simply open this project in pycharm and start
working on it. But if you don't have that, no problem. You can just work on project if you have 
Python 3.5 or higher and venv(Virtual Environment) installed(to create venv for windows, in case of linux,
it is not required). To set up a new venv just "Google"!
To install all the required packages in the venv at first run the venv(go to env/scripts and execute "activate" or "activate.bat) and run "pip install -r 'requirements.txt'. That's all I have to say.
