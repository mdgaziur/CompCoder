# Frontend
This part of the source code contains the guts and logics of the frontend of CompCoder

## Getting started
Install all the dependencies by running `yarn` at this directory(src/frontend)

## How to build
The original idea is to build the code and save the files at ../src. Which will then be served by the api at route `/`. Currently it is not supported. I don't recommend building this project right now. I'll do the work later :3. Or you may do that and make a PR :).

## How to run
Simply run `yarn start`. It'll automatically open the main page in the default browser in your system. Whenever you edit the source code the page will refresh automatically.
