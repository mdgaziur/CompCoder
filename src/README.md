# The API
This part of the soure code(except `frontend`) contains the guts and logics for the api.

## Getting Started
- Run `yarn` at this directory to automatically install all the requirements.

## How to run
Run `yarn start` to start the api. The api will restart whenever the source code is edited.
## How to build
Run `yarn build` to build compile the api source code to javascript and save it. The compiled code will be available at dist. However, the source code at dist is not for developing purpose, rather it's only for production purpose.
